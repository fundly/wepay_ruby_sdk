WePay Ruby SDK

To use this SDK:

# creates a wepay object you can use to make calls
wepay = WePay.new(client_id, client_secret)

# get the authorization url 
# you send the user to this url to authorize the application, they will return to your redirect with a code in the get parameters
redirect_uri = "http://myexamplesite.com/wepay"
url = wepay.oauth2_authorize_url(redirect_uri)
redirect_to(url)

# once you have the code you can get an access token
response = wepay.oauth2_token(code, redirect_uri)
access_token = response['access_token']


# makes a call to the /user endpoint (which requires no parameters)
response = wepay.call('/user', access_token)

# you can also open a payment account for the user
response = wepay.call('/account/create', access_token, {:name => "test account", "description" => "this is only a test" })


# switching to production
When you want to switch to production, change the _use_stage parameter on the WePay constructer to false.
